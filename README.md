# Real time video & image processing sudoku solver

### Purpose
I am using this as a learning exercise to learn more about computer vision. I will primarily be using OpenCV to
accomplish this. I am forced to slowly work on this while I finish my degree, but it will be finished Soon™️.

### [Project Wiki](https://github.com/ottter/sudoku/wiki) 
As I proceed through this, I will be updating the wiki with notes, lessons learned and my thought process throughout 
the duration of the project

### Status
🔴: Webcam scanning
🟢: Scan and cut out sudoku puzzle
🟢: Solve the puzzle
🔴: Display solution back on image

### Goal
I want this to eventually be able to display the solution to a sudoku on the puzzle itself in real time using
augmented reality.
