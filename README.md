# sudoku - Real time video & image processing Sudoku solver

### Purpose
I am using this as a learning exercise to learn more about computer vision. I will primarily be using OpenCV to
accomplish this.

### Goal
I want this to eventually be able to display the solution to a sudoku on the puzzle itself in real time using
augmented reality.
